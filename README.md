# Ahmed Ahmed 🚀

Just someone who loves to build things, make things faster and craft beutiful software.

I dwell on Discord and Twitch under an anonymouse handle where I code live and hang out with my community.
I'm pretty stealth online and like to keep it that way but you can always find what I'm upto here. Lately
I've been pretty actively posting my work on here and letting people in on my journey via LinkedIn (when it makes sense).
